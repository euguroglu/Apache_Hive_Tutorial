Step 1) Static partition

create table if not exists table_part
    > (id string, buyprice int, sellprice int, buy int, sell int, year int)
    > partitioned by (product string)
    > row format delimited
    > fields terminated by ','
    > lines terminated by '\n'
    > stored as textfile;

Step 2)

insert into table table_part
    > partition (product = 'Soap')
    > select id, buyprice, sellprice, buy, sell, year from table5 where product='Soap';

Step 3) Dynamic partition

create table if not exists table_part_dynamic
    > (id string, buyprice int, sellprice int, buy int, sell int, year int)
    > partitioned by (product string)
    > row format delimited
    > fields terminated by ','
    > lines terminated by '\n'
    > stored as textfile;

Step 4)

SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition=true;
SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict;

Step 5)

insert into table table_part_dynamic partition (product)
    > select id, buyprice, sellprice, buy, sell , year, product from table5;
